# Privacy Policy

This is a silly little game that does not need to know much about you. 

No information is explicitly collected beyond whatever Apple defaults to for simple Apps, and even there, I've turned off every option I can. 

To that end, we will never need to collect or maintain:

- Any personally identifiable information
- Employment, marital, or other status, even if 'just friends but maybe not?'
- Your medical history
- Any disagreements you may be having with your family
- Pictures of that great meal you overpaid for
- Your thoughts on geopolitical affairs

And especially
- What you think of this game
