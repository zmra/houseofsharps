# House of Sharps

The Gen-X game of cleaning out your parents' house.  You never asked for this, but here it is! 

With un ways to lose and no way to win, play until you give up! You did your best, and after all, it still isn't enough. 

Play this while juggling work, home, and family obligations, or while managing your grabby siblings fighting over worthless knicknacks and priceless heirlooms, or just to take a break from actually cleaning out the house.  

Because none of this stuff matters, but hey - give us a break, it's what we got!
